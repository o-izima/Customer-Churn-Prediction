# Customer-Churn-Prediction

**Project Description:**

This project involves building a classification model to predict customer churn for a bank using the provided dataset "CustomerChurn.csv". The dataset consists of 6237 instances with 15 independent variables and 1 target variable. The independent variables include customer demographics, account details, and transaction history, while the target variable is the customer attrition flag indicating whether a customer has churned or not.

**Task:**

The task is to implement both random forest and support vector classification algorithms in Python to construct a suitable classification model for predicting customer churn. <!-- Alongside providing the Python code file, a critical analysis of the approach and results is required in a PDF report. -->

**Key Points to Cover:**

1. **Data Preparation:** Discuss the steps taken to prepare the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Model Hyperparameter Tuning:** Identify the hyperparameters to be tuned for both random forest and support vector classifier models and explain the rationale behind tuning these parameters. Describe the method used for hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Choice of Evaluation Metric:** Select a suitable evaluation metric for model evaluation and justify the choice based on the problem context. Discuss how the chosen metric reflects the model's performance.

4. **Overfitting Avoidance Mechanism:** Explain the mechanism employed to avoid overfitting in the models. Discuss whether feature selection or regularization techniques were used and provide reasoning behind the choice.

5. **Results Analysis:**
   - Compare the performance of the random forest and support vector classifier models based on evaluation metrics.
   - Determine if any of the models are underfitting and identify possible reasons for underfitting.

**Deliverables in this project:**

- Python code files implementing random forest and support vector classification algorithms.
- PDF report (**Critical Analysis**) containing critical analysis of the approach and results covering the mentioned key points.
